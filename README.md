### Hi there, I am Geizecler Tomazetto.  

"Ohh my Gosh üò®, it is hard." 

Ok, call me **Geize**. 



### A (very) brief self-introduction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   üë©‚Äçüî¨ I am working as a <a href="https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/geizecler-tomazetto(ed7ae466-d9ce-4608-8171-4c3452177cf3).html"> postdoc</a> at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University, Denmark.

-   And also a <a href ="https://microbiomedata.org/nmdc-champions/"> NMDCChampion</a>.

-   You can find more about my research lines and skills <a href="https://geize.github.io">here</a>.

#### Overview of my Github.

The purpose here is the reproducibility of the data described in my articles. In other words, you download the data (accession number indicated on articles) and scripts and follow the instructions described here. Then, you will have the same outcomes - üòÖhopefully.

There are a bunch of tutorial for processing of 16S/ITS amplicons, assembly of genome and metagenome, prediction and annotation, etc. I guess there is no reason to do more.

However, if you need help, do not hesitate to contact me. Do not worry, I won't jump into your project. But I'll be happy if you can cite one of my articles.
